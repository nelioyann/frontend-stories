### About Frontend Stories

The goal of Frontend Stories is to provide a collection of research-backed findings on which developpers or companies can build their own guidelines.

Opinions easily overlap documented facts in this sphere. And what can be once true can become obsolete in another context or in a later date.

In an early version, it also included blog articles, tweets.

You can follow the latest stories on twitter:
