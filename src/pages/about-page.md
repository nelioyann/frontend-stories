### About Frontend Stories

 Frontend Stories a project maintained by [Yannick Nana](https://twitter.com/nelioyann). It uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Notion](https://notion.so/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com).

#### Why
The goal of Frontend Stories is to provide a collection of research-backed findings on which developpers or companies can build their own guidelines.

#### Providing the necessary tools
Opinions easily overlap documented facts in this sphere. And what can be once true can become obsolete in another context or in a later date. And for that reason I will focus mainly on papers with available references instead of blog articles.

In an early version, it also included blog articles, tweets and books.
This approach made sense as there are also nuggets of knowledge hidden in books or article. However, it is also true that 
false information can be propagated through those same medium. 

After encountering such viraly untrue ideas I decided to stick with research papers and documented case studies.
