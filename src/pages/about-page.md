 Frontend Stories is a project maintained by [Yannick Nana](https://twitter.com/nelioyann). 


#### Why
The goal of Frontend Stories is to provide a collection of research-backed findings on which developpers or companies can build their own development guidelines. 
<!-- 
#### Findings answers 
Opinions easily overlap documented facts in the web. And just because an idea is widely shared doesn't mean that it is founded.
 And what can be once true can become obsolete in another context or in a later date. And for that reason we will focus mainly on papers with available sources.

In an early version, it also included blog articles, tweets and books.
This approach made sense as there are also nuggets of knowledge hidden in books or article. However, it is also true that 
false information can be propagated through those same medium. 

After encountering such viraly untrue ideas I decided to stick with research papers and documented case studies.

#### Develoment process
##### Stack
This project was built using the following technologies:
- [Notion](https://notion.so/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

##### Process

1. Notion provides an intuitive way to organise our database. Here we are using it to add new stories write down their description, sources, categories and so on.
2. Eleventy is a static site generator. Here we use Eleventy to retrieve all the data from Notion, before generating multiple pages. The output is just HTML and CSS (no JS).
3. Netlify is then used to host these static files. -->
