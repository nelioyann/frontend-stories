Although various technologies and techniques have been implemented to alleviate the situation and to comfort the impatient users, little research has been done to assess what constitutes an acceptable and tolerable waiting time for Web users. This research reviews the literature on computer response time and users' waiting time for download of Web pages, and assesses Web users' tolerable waiting time in information retrieval. It addresses the following questions through an experimental study: What is the effect of feedback on users' tolerable waiting time? How long are users willing to wait for a Web page to be downloaded before abandoning it? The results from this study suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users' tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.",

Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.",

In a cooperative task with a computer, subjects (N=41) received one of three types of feedback from a computer: ‚Äúsincere praise‚Äù, ‚Äúflattery‚Äù (insincere praise) or ‚Äúgeneric feedback‚Äù. Compared to generic-feedback subjects, flattery subjects reported more positive affect, better performance, more positive evaluations of the interaction and more positive regard for the computer, even though subjects knew that the flattery from the computer was simply non contingent feedback. Subjects in the sincere praise condition responded similarly to those in the flattery condition. The study concludes that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans, as described in the psychology literature. These findings may suggest significant implications for the design of interactive technologies.",

However, when given a choice, users choose the Back button or navigation bar to navigate rather than the breadcrumb trail [3]. Lida-Rogers & Chaparro (2003) found that participants who used the breadcrumb trail used the Back button less often than users who did not use it; however, no differences were found in other efficiency measures such as total pages visited or total time. Participants may not understand the function of the breadcrumb trail as a navigational tool and understanding its‚Äô purpose or minimal training might impact usage and/or efficiency [4]. Mere exposure was considered as a means of introducing participants to breadcrumb trails. According to Zajonc (1968), if the function of orienting behavior is eventually to change a novel stimulus into a familiar one, it is also its consequence to render the stimulus object eventually more attractive [5]. Zajonc (1968) states that the mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus object enhances his attitude toward it [5]. Thus, it was hypothesized that mere exposure of the breadcrumb trail would influence participants‚Äô use of breadcrumb trail navigation during a search task procedure.",
