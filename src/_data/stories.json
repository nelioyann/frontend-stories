Major findings were: (a) Colours with greater contrast ratio generally lead to greater readability; (b) colour combination did not significantly affect retention; (c) preferred colours (i.e., blues and chromatic colours) led to higher ratings of aesthetic quality and intention to purchase; and (d) ratings of aesthetic quality were significantly related to intention to purchase.",

This textual representation of where and how information is located within the website allows the user to link to major categories of information along a continuum of sequential order. For example, the breadcrumb path for a leather chair on the Office Max website would be: Home > Furniture > Chairs > Leather Chairs. The location of the navigational path is often prominently placed in the upper left quarter of the website page.",

                "summary": "Research has reported that breadcrumb navigation improves site efficiency [1, 2]. However, when given a choice, users choose the Back button or navigation bar to navigate rather than the breadcrumb trail [3]. Lida-Rogers & Chaparro (2003) found that participants who used the breadcrumb trail used the Back button less often than users who did not use it; however, no differences were found in other efficiency measures such as total pages visited or total time. Participants may not understand the function of the breadcrumb trail as a navigational tool and understanding its‚Äô purpose or minimal training might impact usage and/or efficiency [4]. Mere exposure was considered as a means of introducing participants to breadcrumb trails. According to Zajonc (1968), if the function of orienting behavior is eventually to change a novel stimulus into a familiar one, it is also its consequence to render the stimulus object eventually more attractive [5]. Zajonc (1968) states that the mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus object enhances his attitude toward it [5]. Thus, it was hypothesized that mere exposure of the breadcrumb trail would influence participants‚Äô use of breadcrumb trail navigation during a search task procedure.",

                "summary": "Web designers are constantly confronted with the problem of displaying large amounts of information in confined spaces. To deal with this designers usually have two options, either present the information on one long scrolling page or divide it into smaller amounts on multiple web pages. Studies have found that shorter documents that require more paging tend to be superior in both performance and preference to longer pages that require more scrolling. For example, Piolat, Roussey, & Thunin (1998) found that participants who paged through documents had a better mental model of the text and were better able to locate relevant information and remember its main ideas than those who scrolled. Schwarz, Beldie, & Pastoor (1983) found that paging was preferred by inexperienced users but did not find significant differences in task completion time or search performance. Other studies have also found no differences between the two methods in terms of user performance (see Mills & Weldon, 1986). However, almost all of the studies that have been conducted were done prior to the advent of the Web. In today's Web environment users quickly scan most information, particularly search engine results. Because of this, it is possible that presenting long, scrollable pages may facilitate more efficient scanning, since users will not have to focus as much on paging while searching for the information. On the other hand, longer pages may be more disorienting, particularly for search tasks. Thus, the question posed in this study is how much information should be presented at one time on a search result web page?",

Although various technologies and techniques have been implemented to alleviate the situation and to comfort the impatient users, little research has been done to assess what constitutes an acceptable and tolerable waiting time for Web users. This research reviews the literature on computer response time and users' waiting time for download of Web pages, and assesses Web users' tolerable waiting time in information retrieval. It addresses the following questions through an experimental study: What is the effect of feedback on users' tolerable waiting time? How long are users willing to wait for a Web page to be downloaded before abandoning it? The results from this study suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users' tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.",

Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.",

Compared to generic-feedback subjects, flattery subjects reported more positive affect, better performance, more positive evaluations of the interaction and more positive regard for the computer, even though subjects knew that the flattery from the computer was simply non contingent feedback. Subjects in the sincere praise condition responded similarly to those in the flattery condition. The study concludes that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans, as described in the psychology literature.

                "summary": "Knowledge regarding how Web information-seekers behave with respect to the structures and cues they are provided with may shed light on general principles of navigation in electronic spaces, and assist designers in making more informed structural decisions. This study examines user movement through hierarchically structured Web sites and the behavioral effects of a constantly visible, textual contents list for relatively small sites or more extensive local views than are generally used on the Web today. The site overview resulted in users abandoning fewer information-seeking tasks. Users with such context dig deeper into the site structure, make less use of the browser's Back button, and frequently make navigational movements of great hierarchical distances. Navigational correlates of success and reported confidence for users with the overview differ from those without such context. Both with and without a constant overview, the relationship between the source and destination pages may help predict the amount of time spent at the destination. Experimental reports are preceded by a review of click-stream navigation behavior research.",
