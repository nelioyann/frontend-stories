In some cases, these load times can be significantly long and induce frustration to the end user. Studies have shown that are users are willing to wait between 2 to 10 seconds for a page to load.\n\n\n## Speed impacts how interesting websites are perceived\n\n\n### Faster websites are more appreciated\n\n\nWebsites that are slow often induce frustration, especially when there is only a blank screen to stare at. In fact, research has shown that faster web pages are perceived as more interesting than slower ones (Ramsay, Barbesi and Preece, 1998). \n\nIn a study, Nah found that the tolerable waiting time for a page to load was 2 seconds (Nah, 2004). At the time it also found that a page took on average about 10.3 seconds on a desktop computer and 27.3 seconds on a mobile phone. Thus concluding that your average website take more time to load than what we supposedly tolerate.\n\n\n### Slow load times\n\n\nThis suggests that loading times exceeding this 2 second threshold can have a negative impact on the user experience. And unfortunately, the reduction of load times often depends on factors that cannot be easily controlled (e.g. request of the server, large assets etc.). In such cases, Nah proposes a different solution to maintain a good user experience, namely feedback. \n\n\n## Solving long page load\n\n\nEvidence suggests that the availability of feedback extends the tolerable waiting time of web users. This is because it provides transparency into the hidden processes of the interface as well as an estimate of the waiting time. \nWhen presented with an estimation of an ongoing process, users are able to alleviate this wait time by engaging in other activities. Without a feedback users are left to guess at what point a process will conclude.\n\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n1. Faster pages are perceived as more interesting than slower pages.\n2. When loading feedback is provided, it reaches 10 seconds.\n3. Tolerable waiting time for a page to load is about 2 seconds.\n"

In these circumstances, the interface's response may fall somewhere between a \"friendly apology\" or a generic uninformative response. Are we more tolerant of a computer that apologizes?\n\n\n### Building an emotional interaction\n\n\nSome research has shown that users will spend more time interacting with a system that provides emotional responses than with a system that provides generic feedback. For example, Nass showed that users who received flattery from a computer thought the interaction was more pleasant than users who received generic feedback (Nass, 1997). Meanwhile, Tzeng found that apologetic responses gave users a better impression of the overall interaction with the system (Tzeng, 2004).\n\n\n## How to write better error messages\n\n\nAccording to WIX, a good error message explains what happened and why, provides reassurance, is empathetic, helps the user fix the issue and gives the user a way out.\n\n\n### Are users more tolerant of a computer that apologizes ?\n\n1. Flattering responses provide a more pleasant interaction than generic messages.\n2. Apologetic responses give users a better impression of the overall interaction.\n"
