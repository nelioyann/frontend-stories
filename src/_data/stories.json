        "description": "Checkboxes and radio controls are a type of input elements used to make a choice out of various options. These controls are often used in online forms where their actual role can be blurry.   \n\n### Checking the boxes\n\nCheckboxes are a type of HTML `input` element used to select multiple options.  They can be seen as square boxes for checking the presented options. Checklists for example, known for splitting a complex goal into simple steps, use this exact pattern.  \n\n### Popping radios buttons\n\nRadio buttons on the other hand are used when one option is required out of many options. The name \"radio Buttons\" comes from the **physical buttons used on older radios**. Whenever one button was pressed the previously selected one popped out, leaving only a single pressed button at a time. \n\n### Using the power of familiarity\n\n> ‚Äúone material should not be used as a substitute for another, otherwise the end result is deceptive‚Äù -- Jeremy Keith (Resilient Web Design)\n\nBoth element have been designed with a real life equivalent in mind to make their usage simple and familiar. That‚Äôs why checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round. Their appearance is not just visual, but indicates what can be expected of them. Making a round checkbox would be like naming the \"push\" side of a door \"pull\".",

        "description": "Page load time is the time it takes to display all the content on a web page. Depending on many factors, these load times can be significantly longer. How long are users willing to wait for a web page to load?\n\n### Websites, speed and subjective appreciation \n\nResearch has shown that faster web pages are perceived as more interesting than slower ones (Ramsay, Barbesi and Preece (1998). In a study, Nah investigated the tolerable waiting time for a page to load and concluded that 2 seconds was the observed average (Nah, 2004). It also revealed that a page takes on average about 10.3 seconds on a desktop computer and 27.3 seconds on a mobile phone.\n\n\n### How does page load times impact user experience?\n\n\nThis suggests that loading times exceeding this 2 second threshold can have a negative impact on the user experience. And unfortunately, the reduction of load times often depends on factors that cannot be easily controlled (e.g. request of the server, large assets etc.). In such cases, Nah proposes a different solution to maintain a good user experience, namely feedback. \n\n\n### How to improve user experience during long page load ?\n\nEvidence suggests that the availability of feedback extends the tolerable waiting time of web users. This is because it provides transparency into the hidden processes of the interface as well as an estimate of the waiting time.\n\n### Key takeaways\n1. Tolerable waiting time for a page to load is about 2 seconds.\n2. When loading feedback is provided, this can be as long as 10 seconds.\n3. Faster pages are perceived as more interesting than slower pages. ",

Although various technologies and techniques have been implemented to alleviate the situation and to comfort the impatient users, little research has been done to assess what constitutes an acceptable and tolerable waiting time for Web users. This research reviews the literature on computer response time and users' waiting time for download of Web pages, and assesses Web users' tolerable waiting time in information retrieval. It addresses the following questions through an experimental study: What is the effect of feedback on users' tolerable waiting time? How long are users willing to wait for a Web page to be downloaded before abandoning it? The results from this study suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users' tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.",

Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.",

In a cooperative task with a computer, subjects (N=41) received one of three types of feedback from a computer: ‚Äúsincere praise‚Äù, ‚Äúflattery‚Äù (insincere praise) or ‚Äúgeneric feedback‚Äù. Compared to generic-feedback subjects, flattery subjects reported more positive affect, better performance, more positive evaluations of the interaction and more positive regard for the computer, even though subjects knew that the flattery from the computer was simply non contingent feedback. Subjects in the sincere praise condition responded similarly to those in the flattery condition. The study concludes that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans, as described in the psychology literature. These findings may suggest significant implications for the design of interactive technologies.",

These cues are usually implemented as text (e.g. privacy policies). In print advertising, affective attitudes and trust are commonly built by using photographs of people. On the web, however, users as well as interface design experts believe that photos impair task performance by attracting visual attention. In this study we compared online-shoppers' gaze patterns on pages with a photo of a person to pages with a text box of the same size. Our data does not support the claim that photographs decrease task performance. In fact, users spend more time looking at the text box. We found that the photograph attracts more attention than the text box on a first time view of a particular page. However, participants quickly learn the structure of a page and ignore the photo on subsequent pages. We outline further research, incorporating physiological measurements to infer user cost and affective responses",

One way to improve user experience is by including images of faces. People are drawn to faces because paying attention to faces has played a significant role in human evolution. Hence, areas on a web page that typically receive less attention from users, such as the right side or below the fold, may benefit from the inclusion of images of faces. Although faces may be useful in attracting attention to particular places on a web page, they may also distract attention from key information. To test this possibility, we conducted two eye tracking studies in which images of faces were placed on areas of a web page that are shown to receive less attention. The results indicated that faces did not increase the number of people who viewed the areas where the faces were located, but that faces affected fixation patterns on these areas. Our results also showed that faces located above the fold of the web page negatively affected the performance of those who were completing tasks.",

Such inattention invariably gives rise to an inability to remember advertising brands and messages, undermining the effectiveness of this marketing method. Recent interest has focused on whether human faces within banner advertisements can increase attention to the information they contain, since the gaze cues conveyed by faces can influence where observers look. We report an experiment that investigated the efficacy of faces located in banner advertisements to enhance the attentional processing and memorability of banner contents. We tracked participants' eye movements when they examined webpages containing either bottom-right vertical banners or bottom-center horizontal banners. We also manipulated facial information such that banners either contained no face, a face with mutual gaze or a face with averted gaze. We additionally assessed people's memories for brands and advertising messages. Results indicated that relative to other conditions, the condition involving faces with averted gaze increased attention to the banner overall, as well as to the advertising text and product. Memorability of the brand and advertising message was also enhanced. Conversely, in the condition involving faces with mutual gaze, the focus of attention was localized more on the face region rather than on the text or product, weakening any memory benefits for the brand and advertising message. This detrimental impact of mutual gaze on attention to advertised products was especially marked for vertical banners. These results demonstrate that the inclusion of human faces with averted gaze in banner advertisements provides a promising means for marketers to increase the attention paid to such adverts, thereby enhancing memory for advertising information.",

However, when given a choice, users choose the Back button or navigation bar to navigate rather than the breadcrumb trail [3]. Lida-Rogers & Chaparro (2003) found that participants who used the breadcrumb trail used the Back button less often than users who did not use it; however, no differences were found in other efficiency measures such as total pages visited or total time. Participants may not understand the function of the breadcrumb trail as a navigational tool and understanding its‚Äô purpose or minimal training might impact usage and/or efficiency [4]. Mere exposure was considered as a means of introducing participants to breadcrumb trails. According to Zajonc (1968), if the function of orienting behavior is eventually to change a novel stimulus into a familiar one, it is also its consequence to render the stimulus object eventually more attractive [5]. Zajonc (1968) states that the mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus object enhances his attitude toward it [5]. Thus, it was hypothesized that mere exposure of the breadcrumb trail would influence participants‚Äô use of breadcrumb trail navigation during a search task procedure.",

                "summary": "Knowledge regarding how Web information-seekers behave with respect to the structures and cues they are provided with may shed light on general principles of navigation in electronic spaces, and assist designers in making more informed structural decisions. This study examines user movement through hierarchically structured Web sites and the behavioral effects of a constantly visible, textual contents list for relatively small sites or more extensive local views than are generally used on the Web today. The site overview resulted in users abandoning fewer information-seeking tasks. Users with such context dig deeper into the site structure, make less use of the browser's Back button, and frequently make navigational movements of great hierarchical distances. Navigational correlates of success and reported confidence for users with the overview differ from those without such context. Both with and without a constant overview, the relationship between the source and destination pages may help predict the amount of time spent at the destination. Experimental reports are preceded by a review of click-stream navigation behavior research.",
