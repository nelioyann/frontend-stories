                "summary": "Web users often face a long waiting time for downloading Web pages. Although various technologies and techniques have been implemented to alleviate the situation and to comfort the impatient users, little research has been done to assess what constitutes an acceptable and tolerable waiting time for Web users. This research reviews the literature on computer response time and users' waiting time for download of Web pages, and assesses Web users' tolerable waiting time in information retrieval. It addresses the following questions through an experimental study: What is the effect of feedback on users' tolerable waiting time? How long are users willing to wait for a Web page to be downloaded before abandoning it? The results from this study suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users' tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.",

                "summary": "While it is difficult to create completely error-free interactions in software design, the issue of how to make users feel better when they encounter errors is critical to the concept of user-centered design. Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.",

This paper describes the evaluation of a “temporal” alternative to the normal “stack-based” behaviour of Back and Forward. The main difference of the temporal scheme is that it maintains a complete list of previously visited pages. The evaluation compares the efficiency of the stack and temporal schemes in an “out of the box” scenario in which participants were asked to use a “new” version of a commercial browser without any explanation of the presence or absence of new features. This scenario allows us to predict the likely usability impact if commercial browsers were released supporting the temporal scheme. The results showed that the relative efficiency of the two schemes differed across different types of navigational task. In particular, the temporal system poorly supported backtracking to parent pages, but performed better for more distant navigation tasks. The temporal scheme also caused extreme usage patterns, with the subjects either solving tasks very efficiently or very inefficiently, depending on whether they used the Back menu. This observation indicates that adaptations of the temporal system that improve the effectiveness of the Back menu may enhance web navigation.",

This study examines user movement through hierarchically structured Web sites and the behavioral effects of a constantly visible, textual contents list for relatively small sites or more extensive local views than are generally used on the Web today. The site overview resulted in users abandoning fewer information-seeking tasks. Users with such context dig deeper into the site structure, make less use of the browser's Back button, and frequently make navigational movements of great hierarchical distances. Navigational correlates of success and reported confidence for users with the overview differ from those without such context. Both with and without a constant overview, the relationship between the source and destination pages may help predict the amount of time spent at the destination. Experimental reports are preceded by a review of click-stream navigation behavior research.",
