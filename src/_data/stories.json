On the average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an average visit.\n\n\nThe study found that making web pages more concise had a positive effect on users' performance, satisfaction, and overall usability. Researchers cut the text by 54%, and users still found the shorter version more complete. The study also found that task errors were reduced when users didn't have to wade through long blocks of text.\n\n\nRecommendation for writing copy text outlined in this study:\n\n- Remove small details.\n- Add tables of contents and section summaries, bullets, numbered lists, bold and colored text to highlight key words, additional headings and shorter paragraphs.\n- Remove commercialism from the text. Adjectives (e.g., \"formidable\" and \"overwhelming\"), buzzwords (e.g., \"paradigm\"), and unsupported claims.\n\nMain takeaways\n\n1. Be short, and use simple language\n2. Write with a clear structure\n3. Provide relevant information\n"

This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who see no color. (Source: [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html))\n\n"

They can be seen as square boxes for checking the presented options. Checklists for example, known for splitting a complex goal into simple steps, use this exact pattern.\n\n\nRadio buttons on the other hand are used when one option is required out of many options. The name \"radio Buttons\" comes from the **physical buttons used on older radios**. Whenever one button was pressed the previously selected one popped out, leaving only a single pressed button at a time.\n\n\n> “one material should not be used as a substitute for another, otherwise the end result is deceptive” by Jeremy Keith (Resilient Web Design)\n\n\nBoth element have been designed with a real life equivalent in mind to make their usage simple and familiar. That’s why checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round. Their appearance is not just visual, but indicates what can be expected of them. Making a round checkbox would be like naming the \"push\" side of a door \"pull\".\n\n"

Avoiding the asterisk can also remove the ambiguity of asterisks.\n\n\n\n> \"Literally including the phrase “optional” after a label is much clearer than any visual symbol you could use to mean the same thing. Someone may always wonder 'what does this asterisk mean?' and have to go hunting for a legend that explains things.” (Luke Wroblewski)\n\n\n> ”While visual users usually see both the asterisk and the explanation at a glance and can connect them with each other intuitively, screen reader users have to manually search for the asterisk's purpose.” (ADG)\n\n\n> “The implications for industry are quite profound. The single most important  \n> message is to mandate fewer fields. More mandatory fields mean less voluntary data disclosure whatever the sensitivity of a data item. Optional fields yield a good data return. A company that wants to extract many details should use optional fields but not highlight them. When users are unsure whether a field is optional or mandatory, users would rather fill in a field than skip it.” (Preibush, 2012)\n\n\n> “In our user tests, a majority of users will assume an empty text field is actually mandatory and expect an input to be made. So much so that we even recommend you to not use asterisks * to indicate mandatory fields, and instead mark optional fields as “optional”. (Axess Lab, 2023)\n\n"

Additionally, the text is often low contrast making it difficult to read.\n\n\n\n> The placeholder attribute provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\".Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content.

Tolerable waiting time for a page to load is about 2 seconds.\n3. When loading feedback is provided, it reaches 10 seconds.\n\n> The results suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users’ tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.

Flattering responses provide a more pleasant interaction than generic messages.\n2. Apologetic responses give users a better impression of the overall interaction.\n\nSome research has shown that users will spend more time interacting with a system that provides emotional responses than with a system that provides generic feedback. For example, Nass showed that **users who received flattery from a computer thought the interaction was more pleasant than users who received generic feedback** (Nass, 1997). Meanwhile, Tzeng found that apologetic responses gave users a better impression of the overall interaction with the system (Tzeng, 2004).\n\n\nAccording to WIX, a good error message explains what happened and why, provides reassurance, is empathetic, helps the user fix the issue and gives the user a way out.\n\n"
