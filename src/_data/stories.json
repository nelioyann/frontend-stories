This is because black and white have a high contrast ratio and because white on black text is less common. The text also states that for commercial sites, where aesthetic and purchasing behavior factors are a major concern, chromatic (colored) text/background combinations should be used. Chromatic colors are more likely to lead the viewer to see a site as more visually pleasing and stimulating. Most importantly, these colors are more likely to lead a viewer to the intention to purchase products advertised on the site.",

        "description": "Page load time is the time it takes to display all the content on a web page. In some cases, these load times can be significantly long and induce frustration to the end user. Studies have shown that are users are willing to wait between 2 to 10 seconds for a page to load.\n\n\n### Speed impacts how interesting websites are perceived\n\n#### Faster websites are more apprecied\n\nWebsites that are slow often induce frustration, especially when there is only a blank screen to stare at. In fact, research has shown that faster web pages are perceived as more interesting than slower ones (Ramsay, Barbesi and Preece, 1998). \n\nIn a study, Nah found that the tolerable waiting time for a page to load was 2 seconds (Nah, 2004). At the time it also found that a page took on average about 10.3 seconds on a desktop computer and 27.3 seconds on a mobile phone. Thus concluding that your average website take more time to load than what we supposedly tolerate.\n\n\n#### Slow load times\n\n\nThis suggests that loading times exceeding this 2 second threshold can have a negative impact on the user experience. And unfortunately, the reduction of load times often depends on factors that cannot be easily controlled (e.g. request of the server, large assets etc.). In such cases, Nah proposes a different solution to maintain a good user experience, namely feedback. \n\n\n### Solving long page load\n\nEvidence suggests that the availability of feedback extends the tolerable waiting time of web users. This is because it provides transparency into the hidden processes of the interface as well as an estimate of the waiting time. \nWhen presented with an estimation of an ongoing process, users are able to alleviate this wait time by engaging in other activities. Without a feedback users are left to guess at what point a process will conclude.\n\n### Key takeaways\n1. Faster pages are perceived as more interesting than slower pages. \n2. When loading feedback is provided,it reaches 10 seconds.\n3. Tolerable waiting time for a page to load is about 2 seconds.",

Although various technologies and techniques have been implemented to alleviate the situation and to comfort the impatient users, little research has been done to assess what constitutes an acceptable and tolerable waiting time for Web users. This research reviews the literature on computer response time and users' waiting time for download of Web pages, and assesses Web users' tolerable waiting time in information retrieval. It addresses the following questions through an experimental study: What is the effect of feedback on users' tolerable waiting time? How long are users willing to wait for a Web page to be downloaded before abandoning it? The results from this study suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users' tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.",

This paper investigates whether the latency between requesting a page and receiving it influence user perceptions of the page. The paper describes a study in which users are presented with seven different web pages with delays ranging from 2 s to 2 min, and are then asked to rate the pages on a number of criteria. Predetermined delays were injected into the page loading process. Pages which were retrieved faster were judged significantly more interesting than their slower counterparts. The implications for web page design are discussed.",

        "description": "When a user interacts with an interface in an unintended way, some errors may be generated. In these circumstances, the interface's response may fall somewhere between a \"friendly apology\" or a generic uninformative response. Are we more tolerant of a computer that apologizes?\n\n### Building an emotional interaction\n\nSome research has shown that users will spend more time interacting with a system that provides emotional responses than with a system that provides generic feedback. For example, Nass showed that users who received flattery from a computer thought the interaction was more pleasant than users who received generic feedback (Nass, 1997). Meanwhile, Tzeng found that apologetic responses gave users a better impression of the overall interaction with the system (Tzeng, 2004).\n\n## How to write better error messages\nAccording to WIX, a good error message explains what happened and why, provides reassurance, is empathetic, helps the user fix the issue and gives the user a way out.\n\n### Are users more tolerant of a computer that apologizes ?\n1. Flattering responses provide a more pleasant interaction than generic messages.\n2. Apologetic responses give users a better impression of the overall interaction.",

                "summary": "While it is difficult to create completely error-free interactions in software design, the issue of how to make users feel better when they encounter errors is critical to the concept of user-centered design. Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.",

In a cooperative task with a computer, subjects (N=41) received one of three types of feedback from a computer: “sincere praise”, “flattery” (insincere praise) or “generic feedback”. Compared to generic-feedback subjects, flattery subjects reported more positive affect, better performance, more positive evaluations of the interaction and more positive regard for the computer, even though subjects knew that the flattery from the computer was simply non contingent feedback. Subjects in the sincere praise condition responded similarly to those in the flattery condition. The study concludes that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans, as described in the psychology literature. These findings may suggest significant implications for the design of interactive technologies.",

They cut the text by 54%, and users still found the shorter version more complete. The study also found that task errors were reduced when users didn't have to wade through long blocks of text.\n\n### Recommendation for writting copy text\n- Conciseness can be achieved by removing small details.\n- Ease of reading can be achieved by adding tables of contents and section summaries, bullets, numbered lists, bold and colored text to highlight key words, additional headings and shorter paragraphs.\n- Greater objectivity is possible by removing commercialism from the text. Adjectives (e.g., \"formidable\" and \"overwhelming\"), buzzwords (e.g., \"paradigm\"), and unsupported claims.\n\n### Take home message\n1. Be short, and use simple language\n2. Write with a clear structure\n3. Provide relevant information",
