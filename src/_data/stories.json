Although various technologies and techniques have been implemented to alleviate the situation and to comfort the impatient users, little research has been done to assess what constitutes an acceptable and tolerable waiting time for Web users. This research reviews the literature on computer response time and users' waiting time for download of Web pages, and assesses Web users' tolerable waiting time in information retrieval. It addresses the following questions through an experimental study: What is the effect of feedback on users' tolerable waiting time? How long are users willing to wait for a Web page to be downloaded before abandoning it? The results from this study suggest that the presence of feedback prolongs Web users' tolerable waiting time and the tolerable waiting time for information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds.",

Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.",

Twenty-four older subjects participated in an experiment where presentation media and text topology were manipulated. A hypermedia system of tourist guide was developed to test the subject's perusal performance in terms of retention accuracy. Results showed that the main effects and interaction were significant. The use of animated graphs, static pictures, and pure text resulted in significantly descending retention when the hierarchical topology was perused. However, the advantage of animated graphs over static pictures disappeared for the referential topology but both media rendered higher retention scores than the text-only presentation. It was suggested that hypermedia interface for the aged should be designed towards the use of graph-based presentations on a hierarchical topology for better retention. Detailed implications were discussed.",

However, issues related to the effectiveness of such stimuli are not well understood. This research examines the ability of a salient auditory stimulus, in the form of a contrast interval (CI), to enhance recall of message-related information. Researches have argued that the effectiveness of the CI is a function of the temporal duration between the onset and offset of the change in the background stimulus and the nature of this stimulus. Three experiments investigate these propositions and indicate that recall is enhanced, providing the CI is 3 s or less. Information highlighted with silence is recalled better than information highlighted with music.",

However, when given a choice, users choose the Back button or navigation bar to navigate rather than the breadcrumb trail [3]. Lida-Rogers & Chaparro (2003) found that participants who used the breadcrumb trail used the Back button less often than users who did not use it; however, no differences were found in other efficiency measures such as total pages visited or total time. Participants may not understand the function of the breadcrumb trail as a navigational tool and understanding its’ purpose or minimal training might impact usage and/or efficiency [4]. Mere exposure was considered as a means of introducing participants to breadcrumb trails. According to Zajonc (1968), if the function of orienting behavior is eventually to change a novel stimulus into a familiar one, it is also its consequence to render the stimulus object eventually more attractive [5]. Zajonc (1968) states that the mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus object enhances his attitude toward it [5]. Thus, it was hypothesized that mere exposure of the breadcrumb trail would influence participants’ use of breadcrumb trail navigation during a search task procedure.",

Computational cognitive models were built to simulate the visual-perceptual and oculomotor processing required to search hierarchical and nonhierarchical displays. Eye movement data were collected and compared on over a dozen measures with the \"a priori\" predictions of the models. Though it is well accepted that hierarchical layouts are easier to search than nonhierarchical layouts, the underlying cognitive basis for this design heuristic has not yet been established. This work combines cognitive modeling and eye tracking to explain this and numerous other visual design guidelines. This research also demonstrates the power of cognitive modeling for predicting, explaining, and interpreting eye movement data, and how to use eye tracking data to confirm and disconfirm modeling details.",

                "summary": "The Back button on web browsers is one of the world's most heavily used user interface components, yet its behavior is commonly misunderstood. This paper describes the evaluation of a “temporal” alternative to the normal “stack-based” behavior of Back and Forward. The main difference of the temporal scheme is that it maintains a complete list of previously visited pages. The evaluation compares the efficiency of the stack and temporal schemes in an “out of the box” scenario in which participants were asked to use a “new” version of a commercial browser without any explanation of the presence or absence of new features. This scenario allows us to predict the likely usability impact if commercial browsers were released supporting the temporal scheme. The results showed that the relative efficiency of the two schemes differed across different types of navigational task. In particular, the temporal system poorly supported backtracking to parent pages, but performed better for more distant navigation tasks. The temporal scheme also caused extreme usage patterns, with the subjects either solving tasks very efficiently or very inefficiently, depending on whether they used the Back menu. This observation indicates that adaptations of the temporal system that improve the effectiveness of the Back menu may enhance web navigation.",

This study examines user movement through hierarchically structured Web sites and the behavioral effects of a constantly visible, textual contents list for relatively small sites or more extensive local views than are generally used on the Web today. The site overview resulted in users abandoning fewer information-seeking tasks. Users with such context dig deeper into the site structure, make less use of the browser's Back button, and frequently make navigational movements of great hierarchical distances. Navigational correlates of success and reported confidence for users with the overview differ from those without such context. Both with and without a constant overview, the relationship between the source and destination pages may help predict the amount of time spent at the destination. Experimental reports are preceded by a review of click-stream navigation behavior research.",
