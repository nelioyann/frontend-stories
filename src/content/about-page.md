# Frontend Stories

## Goal

The goal of Frontend Stories is to make research data, facts, quotes, and articles easily accessible to developers, so they can create their own development guidelines. We provide insights to tackle common issues, such as how to write better content, improve accessibility, or boost performance. Rather than giving definitive answers like “always do this” or “never do that,” it offers various references (mostly scientific) for readers to find their own solution, considering their context and needs.

## How was this website built ?

This project was built using a [JAMSTACK architecture](https://jamstack.wtf/#what-is-jamstack), using [Notion](https://notion.so/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Content resides inside a Notion page. Static assets (HTML, CSS) are generated by Eleventy and hosted on Netlify. New contributions can be made on Tally.so and automatically added to the Notion database where I can review them.

Currently, this project is maintained by [Yannick Nana](https://yannicknana.fr).
